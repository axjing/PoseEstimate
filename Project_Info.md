# Human Pose Estimator

Human pose estimation (HPE) is the problem domain of identifying body keypoints to construct a body model. 
The application of HPE is widespread and benefits many industries. In particular, HPE is used for animation in both the film and gaming industries. 
Another subset of HPE is hand pose estimation which can be used to translate sign language. 

**Our goal is to estimate a kinematic model for the individual in each picture.**

A kinematic model consists of points on each human joint connected by straight lines, similar to a stick-figure skeleton. 
The contour model consists of 2D squares and rectangles that represent the body, and the volumetric model represents the body with 3D cylinders.
Using a basic kinematic model will simplify the problem space and encourage us to focus on tangible results that can be used in real life applications.
